- [ ] Does domain dispatch events and store them?
- [ ] Where/when should I register event handlers?
- [ ] Should Events have a generic "payload" or specific attributes?
- [ ] Confirm database – persist UUIDs for Video medias
- [ ] Events organization – inside / outside domain?
- [ ] Should we validate categories and genres being assigned to a video?
  - E.g.: There is a relationship between `Category` and `Genre`? If so, should we validate that the `Category` is related to the `Genre`?
- [ ] Should we call validate in the constructor?
  - For other entities I did this way.
  - Review unit tests for Video
- [ ] Ask Luiz about `test_invalid_video` type error
